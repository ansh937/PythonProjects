lets find the HCF in common way of 12 and 30 
6|12
2|2
 |1
 
6|30
5|5
 |1
 
SO here the HCF is 6 , 30 can be divided by 15 as a HCF but once the 12 is divided by 6 so we choose 6

Sure, hereâ€™s the process formatted for easy copying:

### Prime Factorize each number:

**Prime factors of 12:**
\[ 
12 = 2^2 \times 3^1 
\]

**Prime factors of 30:**
\[ 
30 = 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 
\]

### Identify the common prime factors:

**Common prime factors of 12 and 30 are \(2\) and \(3\).**

### Multiply the lowest powers of the common prime factors:

**The lowest power of 2 is \(2^1\).**

**The lowest power of 3 is \(3^1\).**

### Therefore, the HCF is:
\[ 
2^1 \times 3^1 = 2 \times 3 = 6 
\]

**So, the HCF of 12 and 30 is 6.**

#*Taking two inputs from the user in a single line
a, b = map(int, input("Enter two numbers separated by a space: ").split())
print(a,b)

#*if you want to write by separating with comma
x, y = map(int, input("Enter two numbers separated by a comma: ").split(','))
